# CSCI3308-Project: *First to Rent*
### Stephen Kay, Donald Boles, Brandon Rajkowski

## Vision Statement
Housing markets are becoming more and more competetive every day.  Unless you are constantly watching the market, you might miss out of the rental property of your dreams.  __First to Rent__ wants to take all of this stress out of your life by automatically sending you a text notification when a new rental listing becomes available that you are interested in.

## Motivation
Aside from the huge market demand for a service like this, we want to learn web-scraping practices and API interactions.  We hope to gain some knowledge of REST API's and hosting an app in the cloud.

## Risks
* None of us know a ton about web-scraping
* There are many principles that go into REST API's that will be new
* Exact framework and language are TBD
* Employing web scraping might get shutdown on some websites
* Overall security of creating an API

## Mitigation Strategy
* Research web-scraping and REST API best practices early on
* Research different frameworks and make a list of pros and cons
* Look into the logisitics of acceptable web-scraping
* The app will be developed locally, so a layer of security can be added at a later time in needed

## Development Method
We will use the Agile Scrum method of development.  This will allow a greater flexibility in the project since as of right now the requirements are not concretely defined.
* Hold biweekly scrum meetings
* Rotate scrum master so everyone can experience being the srum master
* 1 - 2 week sprint sessions to start, possibly adjust this length as project proceeds

## Project Tracking
Project tracking will be conducting in Trello.  Tasks and stories can be written on sticky notes, and during the scrum meetings, we will be able to go through the tasks and assign numbers to the stories.
