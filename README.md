# CSCI3308-Project: *First to Rent*
### Stephen Kay, Donald Boles, Brandon Rajkowski

## Vision Statement
Housing markets are becoming more and more competetive every day.  Unless you are constantly watching the market, you might miss out of the rental property of your dreams.  __First to Rent__ wants to take all of this stress out of your life by automatically sending you a text notification when a new rental listing becomes available that you are interested in.

## Motivation
Aside from the huge market demand for a service like this, we want to learn web-scraping practices and API interactions.  We hope to gain some knowledge of REST API's and hosting an app in the cloud.

## Risks
* None of us know a ton about web-scraping
* There are many principles that go into REST API's that will be new
* Exact framework and language are TBD
* Employing web scraping might get shutdown on some websites

Mitigation Strategy for above risks

Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
